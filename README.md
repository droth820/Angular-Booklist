# Angular-Booklist
Application displays list of books, which are available for download.
This application was created as part of a project to learn and demonstrate the power of angular JS.
To run the application, download the repository to your computer then open the index.html file in your browser. Once the application is open you may click to download any or all of the ebooks. I used the ebooks in this app because they were available and convenient. Ebooks were written to supplement lacking course material in my high school physical science class.
